# Issue

This repository is completely glitched out on my end (however, I tested with my alt account and without an account and it works fine in those instances)

For example, I can't star this project or its forks:

![GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part1](GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part1)

And I get the `failed to load latest commit information` message every time I visit any part of this repo.

The discussions page is broken on both ends, I have not tested others ability to edit discussions. I can't pin [this discussion](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-Analytics/discussions/2) and everything won't load.:

![GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part2](GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part2)

The part that is broken on both ends is that there is no downvote button.:

![GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part3](GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part3)

The categories won't load. I also can't comment:

![GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part4](GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part4)

My comment contained further context. I also can't edit my own post:

![GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part5](GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part5)

I can't view any of my commits either:

![GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part6](GlitchedRepository_February23rd2021_Part6)

I have to reload every time I navigate (whether it be to a folder, or anything on the ribbon (issues, pull requests, discussions, actions, etc.)) as it gets stuck until I reload.

And more. I have tried deleting the repository and recreating it (with the same name) but it still has problems. I even tried disabling uBlock Origin, as I felt there might be an extremely small chance that it might have blocked something due to mentioning Google Analytics. That did nothing. I feel the name is the problem, but I don't want to change it.

Also, when writing this file, I found that the preview isn't showing up for me. After I post this, I am hoping the main article will still be readable.

This repository has a lot of problems on my end. I hope it can be fixed in the future. I am writing this, as I am going to work on the article today.
